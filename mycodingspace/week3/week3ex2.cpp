// Define a class namely Student with attributes are name (string) and score (integer). Both of them
// are public.
// a. Write a constructor for the class to initialize attributesâ€™ values.
// b. Create two student objects and initialize values for them using class constructor. Print out
// all information of the two students.
// c. Create an array of three students and initialize values for all of them using class
// constructor. Print out information of the student with highest score.
// Additional: modify the program so that score is private, and make a method namely get_score()
// to provide reading access to it.
