/*Defines a class namely Book with following private attributes and public methods (also
provide constructor for it):
o title (string)
o availableCopies (integer) which is the number of copies of the book which are
available to borrow.
o namesOfBorrowers (vector of strings) which are names of the bookâ€™s borrowers.
b) Define another class namely User with following attributes and public methods (also provide
constructor for it):
o name (string)
o borrowedBooks (vector of pointers of Book objects).
o bool doBorrow(Book &abook): to borrow a book from the library (must record the book
in borrowedBooks, borrower name in namesOfBorrowers of the book and reduce its
availableCopies).
o void doReturn(Book &abook): to return a book to the library (reverse the activities
above).
Note: Assume that each user can only borrow one copy of each book
Create a vector of three Book objects which are dynamically allocated.
Create two User objects and test all methods (with the created book objects)*/
